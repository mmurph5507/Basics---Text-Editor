**Description**: A basic text editor. Allows standard functions such as saving files, copying, cutting, and pasting text, and word wrapping. The purpose of this project is to demonastrate basic knowledge of Delphi's functions and the basics of the Pascal language. The code is based off of that found under Embarcadero's tutorials (found here: http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Berlin/en/Starting_your_first_RAD_Studio_application_Index_(IDE_Tutorial)) The procedures within were coded by my own hands, however I do not claim ownsership to the code.

**Known Issues**: none

**_How to Build_**: The local path of the executable is 'Win32\Debug\'.
